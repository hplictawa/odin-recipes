    <h3> Description:</h3>
    <p> The <em><strong>Filipino version</strong></em> of Carbonara, as featured in this recipe post, is different from traditional carbonara in terms of preparation and ingredients used. </p>
    <p>Filipino Carbonara is more of a pasta Alfredo with bacon. It is richer and creamier than the traditional version due to the use of heavy cream. Italian carbonara, on the other hand, makes use of beaten eggs with Pecorino Romano cheese and lots of ground black pepper for the sauce. </p>
    
    <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 lb. Spaghetti </li>
        <li>1 Knorr Beef Cube </li>
